# Welcome!
This is yet another project I embarked on; its main focus is to create a simple website with fun and addictive gameplay.

In the future, this project may be migrated into a next.js framework

# How it works
The gameplay will be simple: fight monsters, gain loot, get new weapons, repeat.
This game is an endless dungeon crawler game that players can idle in (offline will not work yet)
